        <div class="neighborhood-copy"><p>The land that became Cedarburg was originally inhabited by the Potawatomi and Sauk tribes of Native Americans. The Potawatomi surrendered their land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the Treaty of Chicago, which required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838.[10]</p>

        <p>The first white settlement in the Cedarburg area was a community called "New Dublin," which later became Hamilton in the town of Cedarburg. The first resident was Joseph Gardenier, who built a log shanty on Cedar Creek as his headquarters for surveying for the construction of the Green Bay Road.[11] In 1848, Hamilton became the first stop on the stagecoach route between Milwaukee and Green Bay.</p>
            
        <p>Most of Cedarburg's early settlers were German immigrants. Ludwig Wilhelm Groth is usually credited with being the first settler of Cedarburg. He purchased land from the government on October 22, 1842, and began platting the banks of Cedar Creek. In 1845, Frederick Hilgen and William Schroeder built a wooden gristmill on Cedar Creek. After eleven years of operation, they replaced the original structure with the five-story, stone Cedarburg Mill, which became the focal point of the new community. Five dams and mills were eventually built along the creek in what are now the city and town of Cedarburg, including the 1864 Hilgen and Wittenberg Woolen Mill, which was the largest woolen mill west of Philadelphia.</p></div>
