<b>FRONT-END BROKER SEARCH</b><br>
Developed for Sewart Real Estate Group<br>

<br>

This website was developed for a real estate agency who wanted a live listing of all the properties for sale by their broker on their site. Her firm had been unable to coordinate the means to pull listings from a more organized API, and so a JQuery/Javascript application was built to pull those listings entirely from their broker's front end - screen scraping search listings from a number of different search results on the broker's site that corresponded with her target markets. This is a useful function for many real estate agents without direct access to their brokers' MLS databases, improving inbound search traffic and leads without the need for complicated workarounds or directing users to different sites. For the user, it gives a direct line of communication to their preferred local real estate agent about particular properties without having to go through the broker's red tape first.<br><br>
